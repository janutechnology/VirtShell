Roadmap
=======
+ Security:
    - Authentication and Authorization in the requests
    - Authorization in the virtual resources  

+ Database
    - Scripts to deploy the mongodb in two or more servers
    - Partition the database and abstract that in a layer
        - That abstraction layer allows us to do dynamic routing, in other words to do routing based on the configuration of what items live on what hosts, 

+ Deploy
    - Scripts to deploy two or more servers with one balancer
    - Run tornado in nginx

+ Integrate
    - Service to build images to virtualbox 

+ Hosts
    - When a new host is added, automatically a new task should be create to install the provisioning_agent (and other agents) in the host.

+ Amazon
    - Create a separated service to interact with amazon api

+ All modules
    - Add unit tests and integration test with other services
    - If the element in the database not exists return a correct status and message error
    - Add logger to all modules

+ Intances
    - Add iptables for the enviroments (limit the access between machines of the same partition)
    - When a new instance is created it should be added in enviroments
    - When a instance is deleted it should be deleted in the host too (physically).
