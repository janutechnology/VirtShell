Roadmap
=======
+ Security:
    - Authentication and Authorization in the requests
    - Authorization in the virtual resources  

+ Database
    - Scripts to deploy the mongodb in two or more servers
    - Partition the database and abstract that in a layer
        - That abstraction layer allows us to do dynamic routing, in other words to do routing based on the configuration of what items live on what hosts, 

+ Deploy
    - Scripts to deploy two or more servers with one balancer

+ Integrate
    - Service to build images to virtualbox 

+ Hosts
    - When a new host is added, automatically a new task should be create to install the provisioning_agent (and other agents)
      in the host.

+ Amazon
    - Create a separated service to interact with amazon api

+ All modules
    - Add unit tests and integration test with other services
    - If the element in the database not exists return a correct status and message error
